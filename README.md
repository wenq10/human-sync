# human-sync
code to analyze the behavioral sync data

Required software, packages and materials:

1. python (version 2.7 prefered, with linux system)
The 3.5 version is also expected to work smoothly, but minor syntax problems may need
cleaning. For Windows users, 3.5 version is necessary to work with the following packages.

2. tensorflow
The packaged used to minimize the loss function with Gradient Descent.

3. pandas and numpy
Convenient to have with Anaconda

4. R (version 3.1.3 was used)



I. the analysis with simulated data (for model validation)

rnd_gen-1.py
generate random networks (fully synchronized) for simulation

rnd_gen-2.py
add noises (of different levels) to the behavior data generated by rnd_gen-1.py

simu_est-1.py
estimate sync strength in one simulated dataset, and calculate the variance explained,
which is to be compared with the true variance explained by collaborators' behaviors.

simu_est-2.py
repeat the analysis in simu_est-1 to see the whether the model give correct estimation 
of variance explained by sync.


II. the analysis with real-world data (for real sync phenomena analyses)

estimation*.py 
is for estimating the sync model with full data
1-for face-to-face collaboration sync
2-for email collaboration sync
the same for the following

reshuffle*.py
is for reshuffling tests

sync*.py
is for calculating sync strength (only analyzed for overtime work behavior)

sync_task*.R
is for analyzing the association between sync strength and task completion
(only for email sync, face-to-face sync is directly analyzed using spss)
